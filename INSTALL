INSTALL
=======

To build and install radare2 and libr:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr

Then build:

  $ make -s

  NOTE: You can override CC, CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS with environment.
  Those variables are captured by make, not by configure.

And install

  $ sudo make install

If you are developing: install it with symlinks to avoid installing
after every compilation.

  $ sudo make symstall

Deinstall:

  $ make deinstall

  NOTE: Make purge will remove *all* installed versions of r2.

WINDOWS
=======

  $ ./configure --with-compiler=i486-mingw32-gcc --with-ostype=windows
  $ make

MAEMO
=====
  $ ./configure --with-compiler=mad --with-ostype=gnulinux
  $ make
  $ make deb # TODO

CONFIGURATION
=============
