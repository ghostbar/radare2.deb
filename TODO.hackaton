TODO for the 2009-10-18 hackaton
================================

Inconcrete things to do
=======================

* Write Vala applications
  - Test the current .vapi files
  - Add missing methods/classes in vapi files
  - Examples can be found in libr/vapi/t
  - Propose new APIs and usage
    - Vala is a good way to express code

* Cleanup warnings
  - Find missing function signatures in libr/include/.h
  - R_APIfy those APIs (sync with vapi)


Concrete TODO points
====================

* r_anal
  - Discuse and close the main design ideas for the library

* r_io
  - Design and implement a undo/redo subsystem that can be
    enabled and disabled. It is actually mostly done, but
    lacks coherence and can be done better.

  - We need a way to get the underlying file which responds
    to the read call (this way we can know which library
    lives at a specified offset.

  - Implement 'S' command in radare2 (libr/core/cmd)
    - It must use the r_io_section API
    - Implement the rest of io-related commands in r2
      - 'o' open - We need to manage more than one file
  - do e io.vaddr and io.baddr get sense in r2? (discuss)

  - radare2 must be able to know the real/virtual offset
    - We need a function like r_io_get_real_offset();
    - We also need to know if there are overlapped sections
      and where those sections are. (like in hiew)

* r_bin
  - Make it IO agnostic (use r_io_bind) (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - Add mach0 file format support
  - Find why objdump can find stripped symbols with objcopy (see /TODO)

* radare2
  - Fix visual cursor in ANSI (raw ascii is inneficient)
  - Use r_bin with r_io to get symbols
    - The offset to read will define the module to analyze and retrieve syms

* r_db
  - Implement iterators r_db_next() and r_db_prev()
  - Write test programs to ensure the data is stored correctly

* r_search
  - The pattern finding functions are not following the design
    of the rest of the library, it needs a redesign and code cleanup
    (see bytepat.c)
  - implement radare/src/xrefs.c into r_search
  - Add support to change the case sensitive of searchs (ignore case)
    - This must be keyword-based. Not globally
  - Update vapi (r_search_regexp not implemented)
  - Enable/disable nested hits? (discuss+ implement in parent app?)
    - Just skip bytes until end of keyword

Portability
===========

* Compile radare2 on many OS and platforms as possible
  - Windows? 32/64 bits (mingw32, cygwin)
  - OSX?
  - Solaris?

  - We should take care about the library extensions (plugin loading)
  - Missing libraries (-lsocket for solaris..)

* r_th
  - Test the w32 port (LOW PRIORITY)
  - Do the same with r_lib (does it works on osx or w32?)
