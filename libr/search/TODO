* Implement xrefs algorithm
  - We must think on a way to do it more algoritmically
* Add support for stepped searchs (skip N bytes after every read)
* Allow to enable/disable nested hits
* Define minimum distance between hits
* Enable/Disable chained hits
* Enable/Disable nested hits (??)
* Added support for negated searchs (find until no keyword matches)
  - useful to find the end of a \xff block
