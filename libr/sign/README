r_sign: signature api for radare2
=================================

Plugins are used to implement data collectors for r_sign.

A data collector is a piece of code that feeds the r_sign
database with information about symbols.

r_sign is configured to weight each attribute with some properties
to be able to determine the semblance between a collector source
information and the playground where r_sign tries to find valid
duplicates of the information stored previously following the
configured attributes and then we have output plugins to 

Plugin types:
=============
collectors - collects initial signatures (libc, libm, ...)        [  INPUT ]
playground - find collected info using the configured attributes  [  INPUT ]
dumpers    - dump the resulting information in ascii              [ OUTPUT ]
             - dump signature
             - dump results of the signature analysis
