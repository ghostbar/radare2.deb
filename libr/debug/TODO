Debugger TODO
=============
* Breakpoints are ignored in some situations.. we must check
  for them and toggle a .dbg variable to break
* ALL threads must be stopped when a breakpoint is handled..
  -- how to do this?
* regio not implemented
  - floating point registers
  - mmx/xmm
  - drX control
* FileDescriptors
  - df -- copy from !fd in r1
* Implement dump+restore as macros
  (dump,)
