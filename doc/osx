OSX
===

To compile for OSX run configure in this way:

	$ ./configure

And then..

	$ make
	$ sudo make install

To install r2-bindings you will need to install r2, valac, valabind and swig

On OSX>=10.6 you need to sign the binary to debug

To use the debugger in OSX>10.6 you have to create a self-signed certificate
using the "KeyChain Access" utility. Then do the following:

Menu -> CertificateAssistant -> Create Certificate
  -> certificate type: code signing

Use organization: radare.org
Name: radare2

When created:

Right click on certificate -> Trust options -> Always trust

$ cd binr/radare2
$ make osxsign

To create the package
cd macports
make
