Do you want to perform more than one search at a time? '> /k0 keyword1', '> /k1 keyword2' and '> /r 0-1'
Isn't your disassembly pretty enought? Try changing values with 'e asm.'
Did you setup your ~/.radarerc today?
You can mark an offset in visual mode with the cursor and the ',' key. Later press '.' to go back
You can debug a program from the graph view (ag command) using standard radare commands
Before entering a 'call' you can identify the arguments passed to it using the 'pm xxi' command
Use the '[' and ']' keys in visual mode to adjust the screen width (scr.width)
Choose your architecture by typing: 'e asm.arch=ppc' (or arm, java, m68k, intel, intel16 or intel64)
Move between your search hits in visual mode using the 'f' and 'F' keys
Save your projects with 'Ps <project-filename>' and restore then with 'Po <project-filename>'
Everytime you run radare, a random file is removed :)
RADARE CUMS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY
Enable asm.trace to see the tracing information inside the disassembly
Change the registers of the child process in this way: '!set eax 0x333'
Deltify your life with radare
Manipulate the filedescriptors of the child with '!fd'
Trace until system calls with !contsc
Remotely open files or debug processes with radare listen://:9999/dbg:///bin/ls
Check your IO plugins with r2 -L
Find cross-reference in raw binaries using external 'xrefs' tool.
Change the size of the file with the 'r' (resize) command
Calculate checksums for the current block with the commands starting with '#' (#md5, #crc32, #all, ..)
Use +,-,*,/ to change the size of the block
Change the block size with 'b <block-size>' In visual mode you can also enter radare command pressing the ':' key (like vi does)
If you want to open the file in read-write mode use -w flag or -e cfg.write=true
Print the contents of the current block with the 'p' command
Command layout is: <repeat><command><bytes>@<offset>.\  For example: 3x20@0x33 will show 3 hexdumps of 20 bytes at 0x33
Press 'c' in visual mode to toggle the cursor mode
Press 'C' in visual mode to toggle colors
You can "copy/paste" bytes using the cursor in visual mode 'c' and using the 'y' and 'Y' keys
Move around the bytes with hjkl! Arrow keys are not portable and are less productive to use
Seek at relative offsets with 's +<offset>' or 's -<offset>'
Invert the block bytes using the 'I' key in visual mode
Switch between print modes using the 'p' and 'P' keys in visual mode
In soviet russia radare debugs you!
Add comments using the ';' key in visual mode or the 'C' command from the radare shell

Find expanded AES keys in memory with /a command
Find wide-char strings with /w <string> command
Enable ascii-art jump lines in disassembly with asm.lines. asm.linesout and asm.linestyle may interest you too
Control the signal handlers of the child process with the '!signal' command
Get a free shell with 'rasc -i x86.linux.binsh -X'
Interpret your own radare scripts with '. <path-to-your-script>'. Similar to the bash source alias command.
Most of commands accept an '?' as suffix. Use it to understand how they work :)
Find hexpairs with '/x a0 cc 33'
Walk inside your seek history with the 'u' command (undo), and 'U' for redo
Use hasher to calculate hashes of portion blocks of a file
Use zoom.byte=entropy and press 'z' in visual mode to zoom out to see the entropy of the whole file
Use zoom.byte=printable in zoom mode (z key in visual mode) to find strings
Set colors to your screen with 'e scr.color=true'
Trace the register changes when debugging with trace.cmtregs
Move the comments to the right changing their margin with e asm.cmtmargin
Execute a command on the visual prompt with cmd.vprompt
Reduce the delta where flag resolving by address is used with cfg.delta
Disable these messages with e cfg.fortunes=false in your ~/.radarerc
Show offsets in graphs with 'e graph.offset = true'
Follow a flag in disassembly view (avoids to disasemble out of the visibility of the flag) with asm.follow
Execute a command every time a breakpoint is hitted with 'e cmd.bp = !my-program'
Disassemble in intel syntax with e asm.syntax = intel
Change the UID of the debugged process with child.uid (requires root)
Enable full backtrace with dbg.fullbt
Manually modify the DRX registers of the child process with '!dr' command
What do you want to debug today?
Sniff your favorite libusb-based application with LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libusbsniff.so ./your-program
Find cp850 strings with 'e cfg.encoding=cp850' and '/s'
Enhace your graphs by increasing the size of the block and graph.depth eval variable
Control the height of the terminal on serial consoles with e scr.height
Use e file.id=true and e file.flag=true in your ~/.radarerc to get symbols, strings, .. when loading
Disassemble unsupported architectures with external objdump defined in e asm.objdump. Use 'pd' command.
Emulate the base address of a file with e file.baddr
Dump the class header information with 'javasm -c <file.class>'. Plugind by radare if file.id=true
Use gradare if you prefer simple frontend for gui users
Feedback, bug reports, patches, ideas are welcome to the mailing list at radare.nopcode.org
Bindiff two files with '$ bdiff /bin/true /bin/false'
Execute commands on a temporally offset appending '@ offset' to your command
Temporally drop the verbosity prefixing the commands with ':'
Change the graph block definition with graph.callblocks, graph.jmpblocks, graph.flagblocks
Use the '<' and '>' keys in visual cursor mode (V->c) to folder selected bytes
Use scr.accel to browse the file faster!
I love the smell of bugs in the morning.
Use the 'pR' command to see the source line related to the current seek
Analyze socket connections with the socket plugin: $ radare socket://www.foo.com:80. Use 'w' to send data
I like to suck nibbles and make hex
I'm in your source securing your bits
radare contributes to the One Byte Per Child fundation
setup dbg.fpregs to true to visualize the fpu registers in the debugger view
To debug a program you can do dbg://${path-to-program} or use -d ${path..}
