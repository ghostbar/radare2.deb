HOW TO BUILD FOR WINDOWS
========================
Actually, if you want to build r2 for windows, you can use native compiler with mingw32 or
cygwin, but there's also the possibility to crosscompile from a Linux box:


Crosscompilation
================

  ArchLinux
  ---------
  ./configure --with-compiler=i486-mingw32-gcc --with-ostype=windows --host=i486-unknown-windows
  make
  
  Ubuntu
  ------
  sudo apt-get install mingw32
  ./configure --with-compiler=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc  --with-ostype=windows --host=i586-unknown-windows
  make
