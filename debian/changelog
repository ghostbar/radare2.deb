radare2 (0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Year's release.  Just in time!
  * New upstream release.  Main changes are:
    - r2 now supports UTF-8, RGB and TrueColor ansi codes.
    - More platforms supported: ARM aarch64, TI c55x+, 8051, Javascript
      (emscripten), ARCcompact.
    - ASLR for PIE binaries is now supported by using the -B flag.
    - MACH0 XNU kernels are now properly loaded.
    - Added support for TE binaries.
    - Identify some PC BIOS and UEFI ROMs.
    - Java Class file parser has been rewritten to support Java7.
    - Python ctypes, D and Java JNI bindings.
    - An embedded webserver have been included, and you can invoke it using
      the `=h' or '=H' commands.
    - Improved JSON output for many commands. Just append 'j' to the command
      and it will use that format.
    - First release with an extensive test suite.
    - Lots of bugs has been fixed, overflows, memory leaks, and many
      handcrafted binaries can now be loaded without segfaults, crashes or
      lack of info (closes: #716192).
  * debian/patches:
    - 01_fix-kfreebsd-compilation: Refreshed.
    - 02_link-needed-libmagic: Fixed.
    - 03_unsafe_snprintf: New, partly taken from upstream commit 1289476 to
      fix an incomplete snprintf that was breaking the hardened build.
    - 04_remove_non-installable_library: New, to fix an extraneous t.0.9.6
      that was appearing in the builds.
    - 05_typos: Added, some typos and wrong man macros.
    - 06_no_forced_rpath: Added, disable rpath when --with-rpath is not
      present.
    - 07_propagate_ldflags: New, propagate LDFLAGS from environment into
      compilation by making assignment additive, fixing hardened builds.
    - 08_proper_tcc_build: Add .so as the default suffix of libr_tcc.
    - 09_fix_internal_plugins: New, fixed a bunch of problems with the
      internal bindings: made the lua check support Debian's lua, fixed
      library prefix, and removed ncurses bogus linking.
    - 10_fix_rafind2_segfault: New, backported from e0f4364 to fix a segfault
      reported by the Mayhem team (closes: #716503).
    - 11_block_libtcc_install: New, backported from upstream 1531e96 to stop
      installing libtcc files.
    - 101_split_plugins_installation: New, Debian-only, to ease packaging of
      the plugins.  Otherwise they ended up in libradare2.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-Depends on valabind (>> 0.7.4) and swig to generate internal
      plugins, plus python-dev and liblua5.2-dev for the corresponding
      extensions, and dh-exec to help with the packaging of radare2-plugins.
    - Updated descriptions.
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no changes).
    - Created another package (radare2-plugins) with the Python and Lua
      extensions (plus the dependency on Vala).
    - Make radare-plugins depend on valac; otherwise the vala extension is not
      functional.
  * debian/rules:
    - Fix a broken flag for configure (--without-debugger ->
      --disable-debugger) that was causing the debugger to be enabled back in
      several architectures where it was previously disabled, and thus breaking
      the builds (closes: #732853).
    - Force --fail-missing on dh_install to make sure that we don't miss new
      files in subsequent releases.
  * Removed the libradare2's symbols file because radare2 doesn't really try
    to have any sort of backwards compatibility.  It's futile to dump it from
    scratch in every release.
