radare2 (0.9.6-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Main changes are:
    - r2 now supports UTF-8, RGB and TrueColor ansi codes.
    - More platforms supported: ARM aarch64, TI c55x+, 8051, Javascript
      (emscripten), ARCcompact.
    - ASLR for PIE binaries is now supported by using the -B flag.
    - MACH0 XNU kernels are now properly loaded.
    - Added support for TE binaries.
    - Identify some PC BIOS and UEFI ROMs.
    - Java Class file parser has been rewritten to support Java7.
    - Python ctypes, D and Java JNI bindings.
    - An embedded webserver have been included, and you can invoke it using
      the `=h' or '=H' commands.
    - Improved JSON output for many commands. Just append 'j' to the command
      and it will use that format.
    - First release with an extensive test suite.
    - Lots of bugs has been fixed, overflows, memory leaks, and many
      handcrafted binaries can now be loaded without segfaults, crashes or
      lack of info.
  * debian/patches:
    - 01_fix-kfreebsd-compilation: Refreshed.
    - 02_link-needed-libmagic: Fixed.
    - 03_unsafe_snprintf: New, partly taken from upstream commit
      1289476120c4... to fix an incomplete snprintf that was breaking the
      hardened build.
    - 04_remove_non-installable_library: New, to fix an extraneous t.0.9.6
      that was appearing in the builds.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-Depends on valabind (>> 0.7.4).
  * debian/rules:
    - Fix a broken flag for configure (--without-debugger ->
      --disable-debugger).
    - Force --fail-missing on dh_install to make sure that we do't miss new
      files in subsequent releases.
  * Removed the libradare2's symbols file because radare2 doesn't really try
    to have any sort of backwards compatibility.  It's futile to dump it from
    scratch in every release.
  * debian/libradare2-0.9.6.install: Added the libr_tcc* files.
