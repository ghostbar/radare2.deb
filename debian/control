Package: radare2
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: free and advanced command line hexadecimal editor
 The project aims to create a complete, portable, multi-architecture,
 unix-like toolchain for reverse engineering.
 .
 It is composed by an hexadecimal editor (radare) with a wrapped IO
 layer supporting multiple backends for local/remote files, debugger
 (osx,bsd,linux,w32), stream analyzer, assembler/disassembler (rasm)
 for x86,arm,ppc,m68k,java,msil,sparc code analysis modules and
 scripting facilities. A bindiffer named radiff, base converter (rax),
 shellcode development helper (rasc), a binary information extracter
 supporting (pe, mach0, elf, class, ...) named rabin, and a block-based
 hash utility called rahash.
