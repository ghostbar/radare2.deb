Description: free and advanced command line hexadecimal editor
 The project aims to create a complete, portable, multi-architecture,
 unix-like toolchain for reverse engineering.
 .
 It is composed by an hexadecimal editor (radare) with a wrapped IO
 layer supporting multiple backends for local/remote files, debugger
 (OS X, BSD, Linux, W32), stream analyzer, assembler/disassembler (rasm)
 for x86, ARM, PPC, m68k, Java, MSIL, SPARC, code analysis modules and
 scripting facilities. A bindiffer named radiff, base converter (rax),
 shellcode development helper (rasc), a binary information extractor
 supporting PE, mach0, ELF, class, etc. named rabin, and a block-based
 hash utility called rahash.
